# CICR Website Development

Welcome to the CICR Website repository!

## Overview

This repository is the starting point for the development of the CICR website. As of now, the project is in its initial phase, and we are preparing to begin the website design and development process.

## Getting Started

To kick off the website development, we will be using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: For structuring the content and layout of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout design to make the website visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactive elements and functionality.
- **React**: For building dynamic user interfaces and creating a responsive web application.


## Getting Started with Development

1. **Clone the Repository**: 

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CICR-Website.git
   cd CICR-Website
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:

   To start the local development server and begin working on the website:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the React application in development mode. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view it.
